Nonetheless, following the formula strictly:\n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio = $16,948.9 million / (-$7,448.9 million) ≈ -2.27\n\nThis result is not typically how one would interpret or use the debt-to-equity ratio due to the negative equity value, suggesting significant financial restructuring or challenges.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-2.27}$"

However, we can see from Table 13 (Page 55) that under \"Current portion of long-term debt\" there is an amount of $1,248.9 million and \"Short-term debt\" is $0. Thus, the total debt would be the sum of the short-term debt (which is $0 in this case), the current portion of long-term debt ($1,248.9 million), and the long-term debt ($14,319.5 million as seen in Table 13).\n\nTotal Debt = Short-term debt + Current portion of long-term debt + Long-term debt\nTotal Debt = $0 + $1,248.9 million + $14,319.5 million\nTotal Debt = $15,568.4 million\n\nNext, we find the Total Assets from Table 13 (Page 55), which is directly stated as $31,339.3 million.\n\nNow, applying these values to our formula:\n\nDebt-to-Asset Ratio = Total Debt / Total Assets\n= $15,568.4 million / $31,339.3 million\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\nDebt-to-Asset Ratio ≈ 0.4967 or approximately 49.67%\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.497}$"

To do this, we need the Total Assets at the beginning and end of the period. \n\nFrom Table 13, the Total Assets at Sep 29, 2024, are $31,339.3 million, and from the same table, the Total Assets at Oct 1, 2023, are $29,445.5 million.\n\nAverage Total Assets = (Total Assets at the beginning of the period + Total Assets at the end of the period) / 2\n= ($29,445.5 million + $31,339.3 million) / 2\n= $60,784.8 million / 2\n= $30,392.4 million\n\nNow we can calculate the Total Asset Turnover:\n\nTotal Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets\n= $36,176.2 million / $30,392.4 million\n= 1.19\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.19}$"

We can find this information in Table 11 (Page 53) under the \"Weighted average shares outstanding\" section for diluted shares, but since we are calculating book value per share, we should look at the basic or actual outstanding shares which can be found in Table 15 (Page 57).\n\nTotal Shares Outstanding = 1,133.5 million (as of September 29, 2024)\n\nNow, let's apply the formula:\n\nBook Value per Share = Total Shareholders' Equity / Total Shares Outstanding\n= -7,448.9 / 1,133.5\n\nGiven that the shareholders' equity is negative, this indicates a deficit rather than equity, which would result in a negative book value per share.\n\nBook Value per Share ≈ -6.57\n\nSince the calculation results in a negative value due to the deficit in shareholders' equity, it indicates an issue with the company's financial health rather than providing a traditional book value per share that investors might look for as an indicator of a company's worth. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-6.57}$"
