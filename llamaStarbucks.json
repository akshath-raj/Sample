        "answer": "To calculate the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), we need to use the formula: Net Operating Profit After Tax / Invested Capital.\n\nFrom Table 6, we can find the Net earnings attributable to Starbucks, which can be used as a proxy for Net Operating Profit After Tax. For Sep 29, 2024, it is $3,760.9 million.\n\nTo find the Invested Capital, we need to look at Table 13, which provides the balance sheet data. Invested Capital can be calculated as Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities + Long-term Debt. However, since we don't have a clear breakdown of non-interest-bearing current liabilities, we will use Total Assets - Total Current Liabilities + Long-term Debt as an approximation.\n\nFrom Table 13, for Sep 29, 2024:\n- Total Assets = $31,339.3 million\n- Total Current Liabilities = $9,070.0 million\n- Long-term Debt = $14,319.5 million\n\nInvested Capital ≈ Total Assets - Total Current Liabilities + Long-term Debt\nInvested Capital ≈ $31,339.3 million - $9,070.0 million + $14,319.5 million\nHowever, this calculation does not correctly represent Invested Capital as it double-counts debt and misinterprets the formula. The correct approach should directly consider the equity and debt components that are invested in the business.\n\nCorrectly, Invested Capital should be calculated considering the Total Debt (both short-term and long-term) and the Equity (Shareholders' Equity). \n\nFrom Table 13:\n- Total Debt = Short-term debt + Long-term debt. Since there's no short-term debt listed, we only consider Long-term debt.\n- Long-term Debt = $14,319.5 million\n- Shareholders’ deficit = ($7,343.8 million), indicating a deficit rather than a positive equity value.\n\nGiven the shareholders' deficit, the calculation of Invested Capital as typically defined (Debt + Equity) would not apply directly since equity is negative. However, for the purpose of calculating ROIC in this context and following the provided instructions strictly without making assumptions beyond the given data:\n\nROIC = Net Operating Profit After Tax / Invested Capital\n\nGiven the confusion and the direct request to follow instructions without interpreting beyond provided numbers, let's correct the approach based on available and relevant data directly from tables without assuming or calculating beyond what's explicitly given.\n\nFor simplicity and adherence to the formula without over-complicating with incorrect assumptions:\n- Net Operating Profit After Tax = $3,760.9 million (from Table 6)\n- To find Invested Capital correctly, we should look at the Total Assets and subtract non-interest-bearing liabilities, but since this isn't directly calculable from given tables without clearer definitions of these components, we recognize a mistake in calculation approach.\n\nGiven the direct data:\n- We don't have a straightforward way to calculate Invested Capital with the provided breakdowns without making significant assumptions about what constitutes \"Invested Capital\" in this specific context.\n\nThus, acknowledging the error in calculation steps due to misinterpretation of how to apply the formula directly from the tables without clearer guidance on what constitutes \"Invested Capital\" here, the correct path involves recognizing that Invested Capital typically includes debt and equity. But with a shareholders' deficit and without clear short-term debt, our direct calculations lead to confusion.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Insufficient data}$"
