Using Basic Shares:\nSales per Share = Revenue / Total Shares Outstanding\n= $38,962 million / 1,116 million\n= $34.93\n\n2. Using Diluted Shares:\nSales per Share = Revenue / Total Shares Outstanding\n= $38,962 million / 1,130 million\n= $34.49\n\nGiven the context, both calculations are valid depending on whether you're considering basic or diluted shares.

        "answer": "To calculate the Return on Equity (ROE), we need to use the formula: Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity.\n\nFrom Table 8, we can find the Net Income for 2024: $10,142.\n\nTo find the Average Shareholders' Equity, we need data from Table 11. The Total stockholders’ equity at the beginning of 2024 is $21,581, and at the end of 2024, we can calculate it by adding the changes to the beginning balance:\n\n- Common stock and paid-in capital: The balance at the end of the period is not directly provided, but we see that the common stock issued under employee benefit plans, share-based compensation, and other adjustments do not directly contribute to the total equity in a straightforward manner without considering retained earnings.\n- Retained earnings: Balance at the beginning of 2024 is $20,733. Net income is $10,142 (from Table 8), repurchases and retirements of common stock are ($1,394), and dividends are ($3,794). \n\nThus, the Total stockholders’ equity at the end of 2024 can be calculated by considering the changes in retained earnings since the beginning balance and the net income:\n$20,733 (beginning retained earnings) + $10,142 (net income) - $1,394 (repurchases) - $3,794 (dividends) = $25,687.\n\nHowever, to correctly calculate the average shareholders' equity, we should consider the total stockholders' equity. Given that the common stock and paid-in capital adjustments do not directly affect our calculation without additional context on how they're integrated into total equity for this purpose, we focus on the provided totals:\n\n- Beginning of 2024: $21,581\n- End of 2024: To find the end total, we note from Table 11 that the \"Balance at end of period\" for common stock and paid-in capital isn't directly useful without the full context of equity changes. However, we see the retained earnings balance at the end of 2024 is $25,687, which suggests an increase in total equity due to net income and other factors.\n\nGiven the direct data:\n- Beginning Total stockholders’ equity: $21,581\n- End Total stockholders’ equity isn't directly calculable from provided details without assuming how common stock changes affect total equity. However, we know the retained earnings part ends at $25,687.\n\nFor simplicity and adhering strictly to provided data, let's calculate the average shareholders' equity using the beginning total equity and recognizing that without the exact end-of-period total equity, our calculation might not fully capture all nuances:\n\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = (Beginning Total stockholders’ equity + Ending Total stockholders’ equity) / 2\n\nSince we don't have the exact ending total equity but know the retained earnings component ends at $25,687 and assuming other components like common stock and paid-in capital adjustments are part of the total equity changes, we might approximate or directly use provided totals if applicable.\n\nHowever, given the data provided and focusing on what's directly calculable:\n- We can see the beginning and ending retained earnings but not the full breakdown of how common stock and paid-in capital affect the total at the end of 2024 without more context.\n\nThus, to calculate ROE with available data:\nNet Income = $10,142\nAverage Shareholders' Equity, if we only consider the beginning and assume the ending is somewhat reflected in retained earnings changes but lack full detail for an exact average, poses a challenge.\n\nGiven this, let's proceed with what we can directly calculate or infer:\n- Beginning Total stockholders’ equity: $21,581\n- Ending Retained Earnings: $25,687\n\nWithout the precise ending total equity, calculating the exact average shareholders' equity as per the formula is challenging. However, if we were to simplify and consider just the retained earnings part for a rough estimation (acknowledging this doesn't fully capture the ROE calculation's nuance):\nAverage based on Retained Earnings = ($20,733 + $25,687) / 2 = $23,210\n\nThen, ROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity ≈ $10,142 / $23,210 ≈ 0.436 or 43.6%\n\nPlease note, this calculation uses a simplification due to the complexity and potential missing pieces in directly calculating the average total shareholders' equity as intended by the formula. For precise ROE, one would ideally calculate the exact average shareholders' equity using comprehensive data on both beginning and ending total stockholders’ equity."

        "formula": "Net Operating Profit After Tax / Invested Capital",
        "answer": "To calculate the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), we need to use the formula:\n\nROIC = Net Operating Profit After Tax / Invested Capital\n\nFrom Table 8, we can find the Net Operating Profit After Tax and the necessary components to calculate Invested Capital.\n\n1. **Net Operating Profit After Tax**: This is essentially the operating income after adjusting for taxes. The operating income for September 29, 2024, is $10,071 (from Table 8). However, to get the net operating profit after tax, we should consider the income tax expense related to operations.\n\n   - Income from continuing operations before income taxes = $10,336\n   - Income tax expense = $226\n\n   Thus, Net Operating Profit After Tax = $10,336 (Income from continuing operations before income taxes) - $226 (Income tax expense) = $10,110.\n\n2. **Invested Capital**: Invested capital includes both debt and equity. From Table 7, we can find the total liabilities and the total equity by subtracting total liabilities from total assets.\n\n   - Total liabilities = $28,880\n   - Total assets = $55,154\n\n   Thus, Total equity = Total assets - Total liabilities = $55,154 - $28,880 = $26,274.\n\n   Invested Capital = Total debt (short-term and long-term) + Equity. From Table 7:\n   \n   - Short-term debt = $1,364\n   - Long-term debt = $13,270\n   \n   So, Total debt = $1,364 + $13,270 = $14,634.\n   \n   Invested Capital = Total debt + Equity = $14,634 + $26,274 = $40,908.\n\nNow, we can calculate the ROIC:\n\nROIC = Net Operating Profit After Tax / Invested Capital\n\nROIC = $10,110 / $40,908 ≈ 0.247 or 24.7%.\n\nTherefore, the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is approximately **24.7%**."
