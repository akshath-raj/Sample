        "formula": "Operating Income + Depreciation + Amortization",
        "answer": "To calculate EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization), we use the formula:\n\nEBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation + Amortization\n\nFrom Table 4, we can find the Operating Income for 2023:\n- Income from operations = $35 (in millions, as the table implies percentages but these are actual values in millions based on the context of financial reporting)\n\nTo find Depreciation and Amortization, we look at Tables 20 and 25:\n\n1. **Depreciation**: This can be inferred from the change in Accumulated Depreciation in Table 20.\n   - Accumulated depreciation for 2023 = $33,134 million\n   - Accumulated depreciation for 2022 = $24,975 million\n   - Therefore, Depreciation for 2023 = $33,134 million - $24,975 million = $8,159 million\n\n2. **Amortization**: This can be found in Table 25 by looking at the change in Accumulated Amortization.\n   - Accumulated amortization for 2023 = $430 million\n   - Accumulated amortization for 2022 = $458 million (for the finite-lived assets, as we don't have a direct previous year's value to calculate the difference)\n   - However, since we are calculating for 2023 and need the amortization expense for that year, we should directly consider the amortization amounts. The table doesn't provide a straightforward previous year's net carrying amount to calculate the annual amortization directly without assuming it's the difference in accumulated amortization, which might not be accurate without knowing the exact previous year's gross and net values. \n   - Given this complexity and focusing on available data for 2023:\n     - The total amortization expense can actually be derived from the change in accumulated amortization over the year, but since we don't have a clear \"previous\" year's value to subtract from (as my initial approach suggested), let's correct the understanding: \n       - For Acquired technology, the amortization would be based on its gross carrying amount and useful life. However, without explicit annual amortization amounts or a clear indication of how much was amortized in 2023 specifically from Table 25, we must recognize that typically, amortization expense for intangible assets like these would be calculated based on their remaining useful lives and gross carrying values at the start of the period.\n       - Since we aim to calculate EBITDA for 2023 and lack explicit annual amortization figures or a clear method to derive them directly from Table 25 without making assumptions about previous years' balances, let's proceed with what we can infer directly.\n\nGiven these considerations and aiming to follow instructions precisely while acknowledging potential gaps in direct calculation steps due to table interpretations:\n\n- **Operating Income** for 2023 = $35 million (from Table 4)\n- **Depreciation** for 2023 = $8,159 million (calculated from the change in accumulated depreciation)\n\nFor **Amortization**, without explicit figures or a clear method to calculate it directly from provided tables for 2023 specifically and recognizing my earlier approach might have led to confusion by suggesting calculations not directly supported by the tables:\n\nLet's focus on what we can accurately derive:\n- EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation + Amortization\n\nGiven the potential misunderstanding in calculating amortization directly and focusing on provided data:\n- We acknowledge the need for explicit amortization figures or a clearer method to calculate it from the given tables, which seems not directly feasible based on the information provided.\n\nThus, with the direct values we have:\n- Operating Income = $35 million\n- Depreciation = $8,159 million\n\nAnd recognizing the gap in calculating Amortization due to interpretation and direct data availability:\n\nThe precise calculation of EBITDA including accurate amortization figures for 2023 cannot be completed as intended without making assumptions beyond the provided table data. \n\nHowever, adding the known components:\n- $35 million (Operating Income) + $8,159 million (Depreciation) = $8,194 million\n\nWithout the explicit Amortization figure for 2023 or a clear method to calculate it from the tables as provided and aiming to adhere strictly to instructions:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8194}$"

        "formula": "Net Operating Profit After Tax / Invested Capital",
        "answer": "To calculate the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), we need two pieces of information: Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT) and Invested Capital.\n\n1. **Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT):** This can be calculated using the data from Table 3. We start with the Income before provision for income taxes and then subtract the Provision for income taxes to get the Net income. However, to get NOPAT, we should ideally adjust the net income for non-operating items. From Table 3, for 2023:\n   - Income before provision for income taxes = $47,428 million\n   - Provision for income taxes = $8,330 million\n   - Therefore, Net income = $47,428 million - $8,330 million = $39,098 million\n\n   Since we don't have explicit non-operating items to adjust for in the provided tables (like interest income or expense that's not part of operations), we'll proceed with the understanding that our NOPAT is approximated by the net income, acknowledging this might not perfectly represent NOPAT without further adjustments.\n\n2. **Invested Capital:** This includes both debt and equity. From Table 7 for 2023:\n   - Total liabilities = $76,455 million\n   - Total assets = $229,623 million\n   - To find the total equity (which is part of invested capital), we subtract total liabilities from total assets: $229,623 million - $76,455 million = $153,168 million\n\n   Invested Capital = Debt + Equity. Here, debt includes all liabilities, and equity is as calculated:\n   - Invested Capital = $76,455 million (Total liabilities) + $153,168 million (Equity) = $229,623 million\n\nHowever, for the purpose of calculating ROIC, we typically consider only the capital that is invested in operations, which might not include all liabilities (such as deferred taxes or certain non-interest-bearing liabilities). Given the data provided, we'll use total liabilities and equity as a proxy for invested capital.\n\n**ROIC Calculation:**\n\nGiven the potential approximation in NOPAT and the broad definition of Invested Capital used here:\n- NOPAT ≈ Net income = $39,098 million\n- Invested Capital = $229,623 million\n\nROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital = $39,098 million / $229,623 million\n\nROIC ≈ 0.170 or 17.0%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is approximately **17.0%**."
